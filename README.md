# aoc2015

These are the inputs and solutions for the Advent of Code 2015.

I wanted to go through these to brush up on syntax of various languages and
get some fun practice in at the same time.

I'll be dividing this repo into sections based on language, to give myself room
to do this in a variety of languages over time.
