# aoc2015py

These are the inputs and solutions for the Advent of Code 2015, written in Python.

I wanted to go through these to brush up on my Python syntax and get some fun
practice in at the same time.

When running the code from any day, the answers will be printed to standard output,
with the part 1 answer first, and part 2 answer second.
